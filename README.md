# train-gpt2-tensorflow
This Repository contains a jupyter notebook with the code and description of a fine tuned GPT2 model that can read a text and tell the location where the described events took place.  
The motivation of the project is to use a transformer model to extract specific data from raw text, which might at some point be useful to extract data from documents and websites.
